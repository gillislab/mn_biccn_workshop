Notebook illustrating the basic MetaNeighbor pipeline with BICCN data. Developed for the BICCN Omics workshop (22/06/15).
You can access [the online version](./metaneighbor_biccn_workshop.md), the [PDF version](./metaneighbor_biccn_workshop.pdf), and the interactive [Rmd version](./metaneighbor_biccn_workshop.Rmd).
To run the interactive version, all you need is a decently up-to-date R installation, all packages and data are automatically downloaded as part of the notebook.
